   <p id="tribute-info"> <u>Origins</u><br><br>
     In 1993 five American high school students from Angel Grove, California were carefully selected by the wizard Zolton to become guardians of the earth. They were each given Mighty Morphin Power Ranger status and control over a Dinozord, large fighting machines. Billy Cranston became the Blue Ranger, Trini Kwan the Yellow Ranger, Jason Scott Lee the Red Ranger, Kimberly Hart the Pink Ranger and Zack Taylor the Black Ranger. Later, they were joined by Tommy Oliver who became the Green Ranger (later the White Ranger). Over the next Three years they would repel a multitude of attacks from Rita Repulsa, Lord Zedd and their minions.

        <p class="center">
          In the aftermath of what is now known as Doom's day the child versions of the once Mighty Morphin Power Rangers were unable to counter Rita Repulsa and her minions. They did however go on to live normal lives out of the spolight they had previously been under.
          Although they ultimately may not have been able to save the world, they should be remembered for their courage in the face of such a powerful adversary. They were also able to inspire the generations that followed to keep up the fight for freedom. </p>
